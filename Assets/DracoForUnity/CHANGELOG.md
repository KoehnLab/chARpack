## [5.0.0] - 2024-01-13

### Added
- Support for efficient self-managed encoding of multiple meshes. Users may use the advanced Mesh API to acquire readable mesh data for multiple meshes at once and pass the data on to new `DracoEncoder.EncodeMesh` overloads that accept said `MeshData`.
- Vertex attributes information (draco identifier and dimensions) was added to `EncodeResult`
- Support for iOS simulator
- Support for Windows ARM64 architecture.
- Support for Android x86_64
- Package samples
  - *Draco Decoding*. Demonstrates how to decode Draco data at runtime.
  - *Draco Encoding*. Demonstrates how to encode Draco data at runtime.
  - *Scene/GameObject Encoding/Decoding via Menu*. Encode Meshes, GameObjects or entire Scenes via the Tools and Assets menu and have them decoded when the scene loads.
- Support for decoding generic Draco attributes into arbitrary Unity vertex attributes (e.g. tangents) via [`DecodeMesh`](xref:Draco.DracoDecoder.DecodeMesh*)'s `attributeIdMap` parameter.

### Changed
- Decoding API was refactored and harmonized with encoding. The main entry point now is [`DracoDecoder.DecodeMesh`](xref:Draco.DracoDecoder.DecodeMesh*).
  - [`decodeSettings`](xref:Draco.DecodeSettings) parameter encapsulates decode related settings.
  - `attributeIdMap` parameter allows Draco attribute identifier to Unity vertex attribute assignment.
- Encoding API was refactored and now utilizes [`QuantizationSettings`](xref:Draco.Encode.QuantizationSettings) and [`SpeedSettings`](xref:Draco.Encode.SpeedSettings).
- Much faster encoding due to the use of the C# Job System (threads)
- Faster encoding due to avoiding a full memory copy of the result
- All encoding methods are async now
- Readonly meshes now can be encoded in the Editor
- Removed Editor-only `sync` parameter from `DracoMeshLoader.ConvertDracoMeshToUnity` to make API stable (regardless of environment/scripting defines)
- WebGL native libraries are now installed via sub-packages
- Minimum required Unity version was decreased to 2020.3 (possible because the WebGL version restriction was lifted with the sub-packages)
- Automatic code formatting was applied to all source files
- Consolidated split libraries into a single library named `draco_unity`
- Updated Draco native library binaries to [3.1.0](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/draco/releases/tag/unity%2F3.1.0)
- Bumped Burst dependency to version 1.8.11
- Renamed assembly definition `DracoEditor` to `Draco.Editor`
- Renamed assembly definition `DracoRuntimeTests` to `Draco.Tests`
- CI maintenance

### Deprecated
- `DracoMeshLoader` (in favor of [`DracoDecoder`](xref:Draco.DracoDecoder))
- `DracoEncoder.EncodeMesh` overloads that have many individual settings parameters instead of [`QuantizationSettings`](xref:Draco.Encode.QuantizationSettings)/[`SpeedSettings`](xref:Draco.Encode.SpeedSettings).

### Removed
- Obsolete console error about downgrading package for certain Unity versions
- Menu items under `Tools` -> `Draco`. They can be brought back by installing the *Draco Tools Menu* package sample.

### Fixed
- WebGL build with Unity 2022 and newer (due to WebGL sub-packages).
- Destroying temporary copy (instead of original) GameObject when encoding selected GameObject from the menu
- Reference assembly definitions in `DracoEncoder` by name instead of GUID to avoid package import errors.
- Decoded mesh's bounds are calculated and returned/set accordingly.
- Properly dispose NativeArrays in case of error (fixes atteneder/DracoUnity#53)
- Point clouds' index buffer is properly initialized (fixes atteneder/DracoUnity#64)
- Properly set root namespace on all assembly definitions
- Compilation succeeds on non-supported platforms
- Crash in async Editor import

## [3.3.0] - 2021-09-11

### Added
- Point cloud support (thanks [@camnewnham][camnewnham] for #28)

## [3.2.0] - 2021-08-27

- Less memory usage and better performance by creating 16-bit unsigned integer indices for small meshes

## [3.1.0] - 2020-07-12

### Added
- `forceUnityLayout` parameter, to enforce a blend-shape and skinning compatible vertex buffer layout

## [3.0.3] - 2020-06-09

### Added
- Support for Lumin / Magic Leap

## [3.0.2] - 2020-05-26

### Fixed
- Resolved Burst compiler errors (unresolved symbols on macOS) by setting correct native library reference (fixes #18)

## [3.0.1] - 2021-05-21

### Fixed
- AOT Burst compilation errors

## [3.0.0] - 2021-05-18

### Changed
- `DracoMeshLoader`'s coordinate space conversion from right-hand (like in glTF) to left-hand (Unity) changed. Now this is performed by inverting the X-axis (before the Z-axis was inverted). Compared to the previous behaviour, meshes are rotated 180° along the up-axis (Y). This was done to better conform to the glTF specification.

## [2.0.1] - 2021-05-21

### Fixed
- AOT Burst compilation errors

## [2.0.0] - 2021-05-17

- Experimental encoding support (ability to convert Unity Meshes into compressed Draco)
- Performance improvements
  - Two-step decoding allows to do more work of step two in threaded Jobs
  - Utilizes Advanced Mesh API
  - Uses `MeshDataArray` to shift more work to Jobs (Unity 2020.2 and newer)
- Burst
- Unit tests
- Require Normals/Tangents parameter (necessity when using Advanced Mesh API). If true, even if the draco mesh does not have the required vertex attributes, buffers for them will get allocated and the values are calculated.
- Parameter for coordinate space conversion (was on by default before)

### Changes
- API is now async/await based
- Updated native Draco libraries (based on version 1.4.1)

## [1.4.0] - 2021-01-31

- Support for bone weights and joints by providing attribute IDs. Needed for glTF skinning.

## [1.2.0] - 2020-02-24

## [1.1.2] - 2020-02-01
